Container: The <div class="container"> element is a Bootstrap container, which is used to contain, pad, and 
    (if needed) center the content within it.

Heading and Description: Inside the container, there's an <h1> heading for "Volume Calculator" and a <p> 
    paragraph describing what the user needs to do.

Form: This code contains an HTML form element <form form method='POST'> that presumably is intended to submit 
    data to a server using the POST method.

Input Fields: Inside the form, there are three input fields wrapped in <div> elements. Each <input> field 
    represents a dimension (presumably length, width, and height) for calculating volume. The placeholder 
    attribute provides a hint to the user about what to enter, and the value attribute seems to be using 
    template syntax ({{dim_1}}, {{dim_2}}, {{dim_3}}) to dynamically populate values, likely coming from a backend source.

Output Placeholder: There's a <p> element with {{output}} inside, likely intended to display the result of 
    the volume calculation.

Calculate Button: Finally, there's a button with the class "btn btn-warning". This button likely submits the 
form when clicked, triggering the calculation on the server side.

It seems like this code is intended to be part of a web application where users can input dimensions, which 
are then sent to a server for volume calculation, and the result is displayed back to the user. The backend 
(which is not included in this snippet) is expected to handle the form submission, perform the calculation, 
and then render a response back to the user, possibly using a templating engine like Jinja2 to populate dynamic content. -->
